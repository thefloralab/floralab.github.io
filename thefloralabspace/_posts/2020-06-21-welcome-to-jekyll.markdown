Hello internet. This is the first ever post on what I hope will become a journal of sorts. I find that it has been difficult to find a 
single resource that has been great for finding differences between different plant cultivars so I figured with my work background that 
this website would be a great place to start a reference guide. I've been trying out a lot off different projects over the past few months
and wanted to start documenting my findings. Worst case scenario I can review what I've learned. Best case scenario someone else out there
will find this to be a helpful resource. My hope is that there will one day be contributors that will help out in all this knowledge sharing.
I'm excited for this journey.
